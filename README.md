# My-HTTP-HTTPS-Diagrams.

HTTP vs. HTTPS: A Visual Comparison.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

Plaintext communication: Data is transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.
No encryption: Does not use encryption to protect data during transmission.
Less secure: Considered less secure due to the lack of encryption.
Port 80: Typically uses port 80 for communication

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):

Encrypted communication: Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to intercept or read.
SSL/TLS certificate: Requires an SSL/TLS certificate to establish a secure connection.
More secure: Considered more secure due to the encryption layer.
Port 443: Typically uses port 443 for communication.
